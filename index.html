							<h2>Lijiang, China</h2>
						</header>
						<div class="content">
							<p>Lijiang is in the southwest of China in Yunnan Province, which borders both Tibet and Vietnam. Its Unesco-recognised Dayan Old Town keeps 800 years of history alive; Han and Zang-era, timber-framed houses covered in carvings of flowers and birds are well-preserved. They line the meandering alleyways of the ‘old tea horse caravan trail’, which are easy enough to get lost in, even though they’re laid out according to feng shui principles. It’s no museum – as night falls and red lanterns are lit, dongjing dancers set the rhythm and the occasional singing competition erupts; in the central square Si Fang Jie, a bonfire is lit at 7pm. Day-trips beyond the city limits are rewarded with dragon-emblazoned pavilions atop mountains, whisper-quiet lakes and villages that keep centuries-old customs, where the native Nakhi showcase their intricate embroidery and the Mosuo’s Kingdom of Women makes do without men.</p>

							<h2>What to Eat</h2>
						</header>
						<div class="content">
							<p>Lijiang boasts the largest breeding base of Sanwen fish in China. Sanwen fish is cold-water fish, so the glacial melt water of snow mountain is particularly suitable for raising Sanwen fish either in water-quality or in water-temperature. The fry of Sanwen fish in Lijiang is introduced from Nowway. The Sanwen fish is featured with tender flesh and savory flavor, which is totally different from that of frozen products that commonly eaten. Sanwen fish is highly recommended. On the street of Lijiang, a famous snack named Chickpeas Bean Jelly is ubiquitous. Chickpea is a kind of soybean and it is just like the eyes of the chicken in shape, hence the name "Chickpeas" is given, which means chicken eyes in Chinese. Chickpea is main ingredient of chickpeas Bean Jelly. Soak the chickpea, grind the socked beans into soya-bean milk, boil it the milk until it turns gray-white and pour it into different-shape containers for modeling, then Chickpeas Bean Jelly is made. Seasoned with red pepper, green leek, green onions, mustard, vinegar and other seasonings, the chickpeas bean jelly is so luring in appearance and palatable in taste.</p>

							<h2>Getting there</h2>
						</header>
						<div class="content">
							<p>The closest airport is Lijiang Sanyi, a 30-minute drive from Lijang. You’ll need to fly into Shanghai or Kunming first, then pick up a connecting flight. Lijiang Railway Station is on the edge of the city, with services connecting to Kunming, Dali and Qujing. Driving in mainland China is a tricky affair; drivers are usually required to retake their test. We recommend using taxis where possible.</p>

							<h2>Religion and Culture</h2>
						</header>
						<div class="content">
							<p>The religious buildings lie 8 km to the north of the old city in the ancient Baisha quarter. They are particularly remarkable for their murals, painted at the beginning of the thirteenth century, offering precious insights into the lives of the Naxi people. The cultural richness of this minority people is also evident from the artistic sophistication of the houses. The half-timbered structures constitute a unique architectural style, while integrating certain elements of traditional Chinese architecture. Their wooden frames are built to withstand seismic tremors --- the most recent earthquake took place in February 1996. Every house is connected to a remarkable network of waterways supplied by the mountain springs. As there are so many canals and channels, there are also many bridges, which is why Lijiang is known as the "City of Bridges."</p>
